--comes with pyspark
However, default python version for Pyspark is 2.7
To change Python version for Pyspark use:
export PYSPARK_PYTHON='/usr/bin/python3.6'
To make the export permanent, change it on .bash_profile file
vi .bash_profile
the put the folowing line on .bash_profile
export PYSPARK_PYTHON='/usr/bin/python3.6'
----
your HDP by default will not have Python3.6. Install as below:

To install Python3.6, you can use

yum install python36  [or similar will work]

If it does not work, first try
yum upgrade     
the
yum -y install python36
or
yum -y install python36*

---
You can try to change your System python to 3.6 by using [soft link, verify the order of paths in the command]
ln -fs /usr/bin/python3.6 /usr/bin/python

If you want to use packages such as numpy or networkx inside pyspark, you will need to install them.
pip install numpy
python3.6 -m pip install numpy
or similar might/should work.

By default HDP does not come with pip or numpy or networkx installed.
You will need to install pip first
yum install pip
yum install python-pip
yum install python36-pip
yum install python27-pip
or similar will work
----
then you can use pip to install numpy or networkx or similar
---

For installing numpy or networkx or scipy or similar libraries on HDP and to work inside Pyspark,
You can also get : get-pip.py first then use this to install pip 

wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py
python3.6 get-pip.py
python3.6 -m pip install numpy


---
You might need to run the following, if you see Python issues while installing numpy
yum install python36-devel
